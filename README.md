# MCP Knowledge Base

## 📌 Why This Repository?

**Purpose:**  
This repository is a personal and public knowledge base around the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — an emerging standard for enabling LLMs to call tools via structured interactions.

It is being developed as I deepen my own understanding, and may contain conceptual gaps or early interpretations that will be updated as MCP evolves.

**This repo will include:**
- Explanations of MCP communication flow
- Diagrams to show interactions between host, server, LLM, and tools
- Sample Python code that simulates the MCP pipeline
- Notes and references to papers or discussions
- A place to explore new ideas like toolchains, caching, and state management in MCP

## 🔁 How Model Context Protocol Works

Below is a simplified explanation of the MCP lifecycle based on early experimentation:

1. 💬 **User Input**: A user provides a query (e.g., in VS Code, or a browser IDE — this acts as the **MCP host**).
2. 📡 **Tool Discovery**: The host sends a request to the **MCP server** to discover available tools or plugins.
3. 📤 **Query Dispatch**: The host passes both the user query and tool metadata to the **LLM**.
4. 🧠 **Tool Selection**: The LLM chooses one or more tools to fulfill the query (e.g., a weather API or calculator).
5. 🛠️ **Tool Execution**: The host executes the tool(s) by calling the MCP server.
6. 📥 **Result Handling**: The tool returns its result; the host supplies it back to the LLM.
7. ✅ **Final Output**: The LLM responds with a completed answer that includes all the necessary context.

## 🧪 Examples and Simulations

In the `examples/` folder:
- `basic_mcp_demo.py`: WILL add a minimal mock of how MCP-host and server communicate
- `tool_plugin_example.py`: WILL demonstrates tool registry and invocation
- `mcp_host_server_flow.py`: WILL demonstrate full lifecycle from user input to LLM response

## 🧱 Concepts and Building Blocks

- **Tools**: External services (APIs, databases, functions) that LLMs can call to extend their capabilities.
- **Host**: The interface environment where the LLM operates and displays results.
- **Server**: Middleware that brokers tools and handles invocation logistics.
- **Schemas**: JSON schemas or data formats used to structure requests and responses.
- **Context Handling**: Ensuring the LLM has access to prior tool calls for coherent responses.
